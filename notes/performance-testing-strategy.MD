# Performance testing strategy

## Current Implementation (Hello World service)

This test suite is optimized for a simple "hello world" gRPC service with:

- Minimal computation
- No external dependencies
- Stateless operations
- Expected response time < 5ms

## Production service considerations

For production services, the test strategy should be expanded to account for:

1. Longer Duration Requirements:
   - Warm-up period: 15-30 minutes
   - Step-load phase: 1-2 hours
   - Sustained load: 4+ hours
   - Cool-down period: 15-30 minutes

2. Additional Test Scenarios:
   - Database connection pool saturation
   - External service dependencies
   - Cache warming effects
   - Authentication/Authorization overhead
   - Complex business logic execution paths
   - State management implications
   - Resource cleanup mechanisms
   - Error handling paths
   - Retry mechanisms

3. Extended Monitoring:
   - Database metrics
   - Cache hit/miss rates
   - External service latencies
   - Queue depths
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Thread pool metrics
   - GC patterns
   - Network I/O patterns

4. Environmental Factors:
   - Service mesh impact
   - Load balancer behavior
   - Network latency variations
   - Database backup/maintenance windows
   - Concurrent service deployments
