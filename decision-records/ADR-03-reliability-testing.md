# ADR-03: Reliability testing strategy

## Context

Need to define reliability testing approach for a basic gRPC hello world service. The service needs to demonstrate stable performance under sustained load over time.

## Decision

Implement a focused reliability testing strategy:

1. Preparation Phase:
   - Conduct maximum load test to establish performance baseline
   - Use aggressive 90% of maximum load for testing due to service simplicity
2. Reliability Test Execution:

   ```
   Duration: 30 minutes
   Target Load: 90% of established maximum
   Pattern: Constant load after 5-minute ramp-up
   ```

3. Success criteria:
   - Error rate stays below 1%
   - P99 latency remains under 500ms
   - Throughput variance within 10%
   - Minimum 6 stable measurement windows required
4. Metrics to collect:

   ```
   Performance Metrics:
   - Throughput (RPS)
   - Response time (P99)
   - Error rate
   - Throughput variance
   ```

## Implementation details

1. Test Configuration:

   ```
   - 5-minute ramp-up period
   - 5-minute measurement windows
   - Maximum 5000 threads
   - InfluxDB metrics storage
   ```

2. Success Criteria Details:

   ```
   - MAX_ERROR_RATE: 1%
   - MAX_P99_LATENCY: 500ms
   - MAX_THROUGHPUT_VARIANCE: 10%
   - REQUIRED_STABLE_WINDOWS: 6
   ```

3. Reporting:
   - Detailed window-by-window analysis
   - Clear pass/fail criteria
   - Comprehensive test results summary

## Consequences

### Positive

- More aggressive testing approach (90% of max)
- Clear, quantifiable success criteria
- Efficient test duration
- Comprehensive stability verification

### Negative

- Shorter duration may miss longer-term issues
- Aggressive load target may not suit all services
- Limited error type analysis

## Notes

- 30-minute duration suits simple service characteristics
- 90% load target reflects service stability
- Multiple stability windows provide reliability confidence
